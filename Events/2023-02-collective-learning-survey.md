We are computational and social science reseachers at the University of Central Florida who study collaboration and the science of team science. 

This survey is part of a study on collective learning in interdiscplinary groups who develop scientific software.

In this stage of the study, we are reaching out to invite contributors to collaborative scientific software development projects to participate in a short survey about their experiences and perceptions. 
  
The goal of this study is to better understand the relationship between individual, team, and project characteristics associated with collective learning in collaborative scientific software development.
  
The survey is expected to take 5-10 minutes to complete. We would be grateful if you considered filling out the survey. Your responses are confidential and survey data will only be accessed by the research team.
 
If you would like more information on this study, please contact the researchers Stephen M. Fiore (sfiore@ucf.edu) and/or Olivia B. Newton (olivia.newton@ucf.edu).
