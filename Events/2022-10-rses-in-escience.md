US-RSE is organizing a workshop as part of the IEEE eScience 2022 conference (to take place IN PERSON in Salt Lake City): RSEs in eScience. This workshop will present RSE contributions to scientific research through a series of talks that explore scientific project needs, how access to RSEs made the project successful, and how this work can be applied to future scientific research efforts. The workshop will be of interest to existing RSEs, potential RSEs, domain scientists, and software developers who want to understand the lessons from both good and bad research software engineering experiences.
