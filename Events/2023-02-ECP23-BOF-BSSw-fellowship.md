The Exascale Computing Project (ECP) 2023 Community Birds-of-a-Feather (BOF) Days will take place from February 14, 2023 â€“ February 16, 2023.

The BSSw Fellowship committee will be hosting a community BOF titled *BSSw Fellowship*, as a part of the ECP 2023 Community Birds-of-a-Feather (BOF) Days.

This Birds-of-a-Feather session provides an opportunity to learn more about how the BSSw fellowship community is impacting better scientific software and to engage with the ECP community. The BSSw fellowship community consists of fellowship recipients and honorable mentions from 2018 through the recently announced 2023 class.

The Better Scientific Software (BSSw) Fellowship Program gives recognition and funding to leaders and advocates of high-quality scientific software. Since its launch in 2018, the BSSw Fellowship alums comprise a diverse community of leaders, mentors, and consultants to increase the visibility of those involved in scientific software production and sustainability in the pursuit of scientific discovery.
