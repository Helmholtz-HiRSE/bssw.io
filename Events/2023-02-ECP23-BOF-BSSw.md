The Exascale Computing Project (ECP) 2023 Community Birds-of-a-Feather (BOF) Days will take place from February 14, 2023 â€“ February 16, 2023.

The BSSw.io team will be hosting a community BOF titled *Community BOF on Sharing Your Software Sustainability, Productivity, and Quality Experience through BSSw.io*, as a part of the ECP 2023 Community Birds-of-a-Feather (BOF) Days.

In this BOF session, the BSSw.io organizers and the community will share experiences on using and contributing to BSSw.io.  One of our goals will be to continue understanding the needs of the community and shorten the gap between the theory and practical implementation of best practices involved in building scientific software. The long-term vision for BSSw is to serve as an international community-driven and community-managed resource, with content and editorial processes provided by volunteers. We welcome everyone to participate.
