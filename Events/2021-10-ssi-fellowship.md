The Institute’s Fellowship Programme provides funding for individuals who want to improve how research software is done in their domains and/or area of work. Being a Fellow also helps individuals develop skills and knowledge in their area of software sustainability, empowers them to speak about issues, and network with like-minded individuals from a wide variety of research areas.

Each Fellow will be allocated £3,000 to spend over 15 months beginning 1 January 2022. The funding is flexible to support activities that are beneficial to both the Fellow and the Institute. For example, the funding can be used to:

* attend conferences.
* setup and run workshops.
* organise software sustainability sessions at domain conferences.
* nurture or contribute to communities of practice.
* collaborate with other Fellows.
* host, organise or teach training events, such as through the [Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/).

Fellows are drawn from a wide range of areas, experience and career stages. Visit the [Fellows’ profiles](https://software.ac.uk/about/fellows?_ga=2.168036905.922904260.1629296100-326206616.1624207710) to read more about those awarded Fellowships in previous years and have a look at some of the Fellows’ blog posts for examples of funded activities.

In light of the ongoing situation around COVID-19, applicants are encouraged to consider that travel and in-person events may not always be feasible, and plans with online-based activities are particularly welcome.

During the Fellowship Programme 2022 round, there will be up to three places for successful international applicants (applicants based outside the UK or without a formal affiliation with a UK-based institution or office). This is a pilot to help us identify and address challenges for opening and scaling up the Programme internationally in the future, particularly around finances and logistics. Changes to eligibility are subject to new information learned along the way.

Please visit the [Fellowship Programme page](http://bit.ly/ssi-fellows2022) for important dates, more details with regard to international applicants, and further information. [Sign up here](http://eepurl.com/dvOJB5) for updates and to be notified when registration opens.
