# Webinar: Best Practices for Computational and Data-Intensive (CDI) Research

*	Date: 2021-09-16
*	Location: Online 
*	Event Website: https://sites.udel.edu/xpert-cdi/event/upcoming-events/
* Organizers: The Xpert Network

The Xpert network has been collecting best practices that have proven effective in computational and data-intensive (CDI) research of NSF-supported and other university projects.
This webinar presents the first set of results, also described at  https://sites.udel.edu/xpert-cdi/resources/best-practices/. The webinar will be interactive, where key community members, as well as the larger audience, are invited to comment on their experiences with the presented and other practices.

### Abstract
The Xpert Network is one of several projects in the US that aims to improve the cyberinfrastructure ecosystem by enhancing the skills, effectiveness, and professional organization of those who assist Computational and Data-intensive (CDI) domain researchers. Our activity grew out of a need to bring together projects that provide such support. One of the outcomes that we would like to create as a result of this network is a best-practices guide for RSEs in computational and data-intensive research. We have collected those practices developed by different organizations that are in the business of supporting CDI domain scientists, and we would like to present them to you in this webinar and get your live comments on these practices.

### Presenter Bio
Rudolf (Rudi) Eigenmann came to the University of Delaware in 2017 from Purdue University, where he was a Professor in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering. From 2013-2017, he has also served as Program Director in the National Science Foundationâ€™s Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure. His core research interests include optimizing compilers, programming methodologies, tools, and performance evaluation for high-performance computing, as well as the design of cyberinfrastructure. Dr. Eigenmann received his Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering/Computer Science from ETH Zurich, Switzerland.
