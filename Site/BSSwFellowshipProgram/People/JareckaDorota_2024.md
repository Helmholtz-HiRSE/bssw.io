### Improving accessibility of research data and software with scientific web applications in Jupyter notebooks

BSSw Fellow Nicole Brewer is working to make scientific software accessible and reproducible with scientific web applications, which provide accessible ways to disseminate research, teach, engage stakeholders, and even update policy makers. Jupyter Notebooks can be used to easily adapt existing researcher code into web interfaces that hide underlying code from users. Jupyter makes an excellent platform for development because it can be easily understood, inherited, and maintained by researchers. Nicole will develop tutorials for developing web applications in Jupyter Notebooks. She will then compile various example applications into a “cookbook” that will provide a reader with recipes for various Jupyter-based web application capabilities.
