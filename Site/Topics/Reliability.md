# Better Reliability

**Homepage:**  Methods for testing and verification to ensure that software is robust and produces reliable results.

**Overview:** 
Improving methods of testing and verification to ensure that software is robust and produces reliable results, thereby helping to ensure the integrity of research and enable collaboration across teams.

**Child Topics:**

- **Peer Code Review**
The collaborative process of ensuring software meets quality, readability, and maintainability requirements.
<!---Topic order: 1--->

- **Testing**
The process of ensuring that a software product is meeting its requirements at each stage of development, delivery, and deployment. Testing helps to avoid defects and verify correctness.
<!---Topic order: 2--->

- **Continuous Integration Testing**
Testing that is maximally integrated with code commits to promote efficient co-development and well-defined delivery criteria. 
<!---Topic order: 3--->

- **Reproducibility**
Any effort whose goal is to increase trustworthiness and reuse of computational capabilities and results and to ensure correctness. 
<!---Topic order: 4--->

- **Debugging**
