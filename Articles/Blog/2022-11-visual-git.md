Opening up software development to a broader audience means we need to offer more diverse approaches to learning the tools.  BSSw Fellow Amy Roberts is developing illustrated stories to explain essential operations in the git version control tool.

Contributing to shared software projects often requires fluency with version control - but many scientists don’t have the skills they need to comfortably work with version control. There are often only a handful of developers who have the skills needed to work collaboratively on software and this limits the sustainability of software efforts that are increasingly crucial to their communities.  Existing version control training materials focus either on the underlying theory or a comprehensive overview of version control. Such material can be inaccessible to new developers if they cannot identify what information is applicable to their specific problem. I’ve started a new effort to create version control training materials that illustrate stories about core version control competencies, with the goal of reducing the barrier to new contributors who might be working with version control for the first time.

### Why user stories and illustrations?

My BSSw Fellowship focused on developing accessible, user-focused tutorials on version control that give scientists the information they need to contribute to shared software.  The version control tutorials center around common user stories and directly address how a scientist should interact with version control to work collaboratively in common science scenarios.  Art that illustrates broader ideas accompany the tutorials to help new users translate everyday concepts into the equivalent version control terminology.

### Git-Stories

As we develop them, we're collecting the stories in a [Gitlab repository](https://gitlab.com/git-stories).
Each “story” focuses on a single idea, so that people writing contribution instructions and mentoring first-time contributors can point to appropriate concepts and trust that their colleagues will find them useful.
The stories we currently have are:

- [Use git, not email!](https://gitlab.com/git-stories/use-git-not-email/-/blob/master/Emailing_Files_Use_Git_Printable.pdf)
-	[What to do every time you commit](https://gitlab.com/git-stories/commit-guide/-/blob/main/VersionControl_SomeMomentsAreWorthKeeping_Printable_10X3.5.pdf)
-	[Commit early and often](https://gitlab.com/git-stories/commit-early-and-often/-/blob/main/VersionControl_NowIsAGreatTimeToCommit_Printable_18X24.pdf)
-	[Every commit requires a message](https://gitlab.com/git-stories/every-commit-requires-comments/-/blob/main/VersionControl_EveryCommitRequiresAComment_printable_18X24.pdf)

These stories all focus on basic version control concepts. We plan to develop more stories - and develop a community that contributes and uses the stories that we all need to support contributors to scientific software. All the art is licensed for re-use and most of it is available in vector graphic form, to allow easy editing for people who want to customize the text for their project.
