The first-of-its-kind conference will serve as a premier forum for the exchange and presentation of the concepts, tools, techniques, practice and state-of-art in reproducibility and replicability.

### The Promise of Digitial Artifacts for Reproducibility

Science must communicate. The bedrock of scientific communication are the written descriptions of experiments that need to be reproduced or replicated before the results can be accepted as science. As computation is playing an increasingly important role in scientific disciplines, digital assets are becoming a fundamental building block of scientific communication that goes far beyond digital representation of textual documents: digital artifacts can represent complex workflows that, given adequate resources, can automatically repeat experiments, reproduce results, and validate claims of contributions in research labs as well as classrooms, with the potential of greatly accelerating the speed of learning and scientific progress.   

### Practical Challenges

In practice communicating digital artifacts has proven challenging. Communication can occur over time in which a, say, 10-year old digital artifact is still performing its function, or over space in which a digital artifact is performing its function at a different location. The challenges stem from the behavior of contexts required to run digital artifacts: these contexts are continually and rapidly evolving because of software and hardware infrastructure upgrades, security patches, configuration changes, and hardware aging. That is, communication over time will fail in a matter of weeks or months, and digital artifacts will stop working unless updated. Reproducibility requires communication over time and space, including communication among reviewers, researchers, instructors, students, and practitioners. This communication is labor intensive, and the contexts of all these stakeholders are evolving independently so that communication over space is likely to fail immediately.  

### Open Source Software Engineering

Meanwhile, open source software communities have evolved sophisticated technologies to share and organize digital assets according to principles that have enabled collaborations of unprecedented scales and speed, including versioning, branching, pull requests, and continual integration. With scientific communities embracing open science and the FAIR principles, many scientists are discovering the value of these open source software techniques and strategies for research practices. 
The 2023 ACM Conference on Reproducibility and Replicability (ACM REP ‘23) is taking place on June 27-29, 2023 at Santa Cruz, California, USA, and evolved out of Practical Reproducible Evaluation of Computational Systems (P-RECS), a series of annual workshops convened at the ACM International Symposia on High-Performance Parallel and Distributed Computing (ACM HPDC) from 2018 through 2022, and the ACM Emergent Interest Group on Reproducibility and Replicability (EIGREP). ACM REP is bringing together experts and practitioners interested in the advancement and conduct of reproducible science in computing disciplines. The first-of-its-kind conference will serve as a premier forum for the exchange and presentation of the concepts, tools, techniques, practice and state-of-art in reproducibility and replicability. Many computer science conferences already have their own reproducibility initiatives, including awards for distinguished reproducibility artifacts. ACM REP will be an important forum for sharing innovative best practices across these communities with a program consisting of peer-reviewed articles, invited talks, panels, posters, and demonstrations.  

### ACM REP '23

The ACM REP ‘23’s 3-day program includes three keynote speakers, Torsten Hoefler (ETH Zurich), Juliana Freire (NYU), and Grigori Fursin (Co-chair of MLCommons task force on automation and reproducibility, President of cTuning Foundation, and Founder of cKnowledge.org). Eleven peer-reviewed papers are presented in four sessions spanning topics across advancing reproducibility, testing reproducibility, costs and benefits, and benchmarking reproducibility. The third day is dedicated to three tutorials. The conference will take place at the beautiful campus of the University of California, Santa Cruz. All of the program will be designed for hybrid attendance that welcomes remote participation. In-person attendance will be rewarded with receptions on the evenings of the first and second day.
