[Code-review.org](https://code-review.org/) is an online tutorial that helps impart best practices for reviewing code, responding constructively to feedback from others, and offering solutions using Github.

### What are the goals?

The goals of the project are to enable everyone involved in scientific software to:

* **Become a better reviewer.** Reviewing is hard! You really have to take into account how to communicate, constructive and actionable criticism. Practice reviewing in a no-consequence environment using the tutorial.

* **Become more comfortable having your code reviewed.** People will explain a scientific idea with a sketch on a whiteboard, or a napkin with no problem. But when it comes to code, there is a real tendency to keep it hidden. You might have heard people say, “Oh I need to polish this before I show it to you.” There is some psychological effect behind this, and it would be great to change this and get people to show even pseudo-code to each other. Sharing early and often becomes second nature.

* **Use code review as a collaboration tool.** Use code review as part of onboarding new team members and collaborators. Share knowledge and know-how between team members. There is a real benefit to being on either side of a review. We’re trying to humanize this process and build rapport between people.

* **Read more code than you write!** Take a peek into your favorite open-source tools. Encourage people to have a look inside the software they are using. How does this work? Why did they do this?

* **Enable more open source contributors and more open source reviewers.** This is a lofty goal, but there are a lot of people out there who would make really good software engineers, *and they just don’t know it yet.*


### What are the learning outcomes?

Code review is a skill. You can break it down, you can practice, and you can get better at it. The difficult thing is you are often learning a bunch of other skills at the same time. The mechanics of git and Github, which can be tricky. Maybe a new programming language. Maybe you are a scientist learning a new language Or maybe you are a software engineer learning new science. You have to fit into a new team and all the culture that comes with that.

And this never stops! Whether you are just starting out or a seasoned professional, you are learning something. And also you’re going to be learning code review.

As you work through the tutorial, you’ll practice the mechanics of Github: navigating issues, pull requests, adding comments and suggestions. You’ll have the chance to review the pull requests in the exercises, with some prompts to help you along.

### You are not alone.

Code review can feel quite exclusionary. It can be a gatekeeping exercise, particularly for new contributors to open-source projects. There is no easy answer to this, and it takes continued thought and effort within each team or community to find a dynamic that works.

Building community and building great teams takes time, skill, and dedicated effort.
Luckily, you do not have to start from scratch!

If you are the only person writing code on your team, join a research software engineering (RSE) organization and find 
your people.

* [US-RSE](https://us-rse.org/). A community of people who make research software happen.  
* [Society of Research Software Engineering](https://society-rse.org/) which emerged from the successful grass-roots RSE movement and is the successor to the UK RSE Association.  
* [Better Scientific Software](https://bssw.io/). A hub for scientific software development resources.  
* [Campus Champions](https://campuschampions.cyberinfrastructure.org/). Uniting Research Computing Facilitators
* [UCAR Software Engineering Assembly](https://sea.ucar.edu/sea) A community for software engineering professionals within UCAR.
