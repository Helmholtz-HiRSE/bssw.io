# Highlighted Topics from BSSwF Q&A Session

The [2024 Better Scientific Software Fellowship](https://bssw.io/pages/bssw-fellowship-program) is [accepting applications](https://bssw.io/pages/apply-for-the-bssw-fellowship-program) through September 29, 2023.
The Q & A session, held on Sept 12 ([recording available](https://bssw.io/pages/bssw-fellowship-faq)), presented a detailed overview of the program, application process, and [past fellows](https://bssw.io/pages/meet-our-fellows).
This year, we would like to highlight several key aspects of the program.

## Encouraging Diversity

The BSSw Fellowship is open to applicants of all career stages, from students to senior professions.
We would also like to explicitly encourage those from underrepresented groups, including people who are Black or African American, Hispanic/Latinx, American Indian, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islanders, women, persons with disabilities, and first generation scholars.
In addition to technically focused projects, we would like to invite proposal for activities that broaden participation or promote diversity, equity, and inclusion.

## Focus on Artifacts

While many fellowship proposals focus on activities, successful project proposals are more than one-time undertakings.
We aim for reusable, sustainable deliverables that can live beyond the fellowship.
These artifacts can come in the form of videos (include HPC Best Practices webinars), written content, interactive websites, and more.
Past fellows have leveraged the BSSw.io blog as well.

## Technical vs. Social Perspective

During the Q & A session, the following question was asked:
*Are the projects mostly social or technical in nature?*

Since the DOE, NSF, and CSE communities are deeply technical, a relevant topic expected.
That said, technical information must be presented with a social awareness.
Successful projects understand how to communicate technical information such that it is useful to the larger community and can be used for something more.
The goal is to increase engagement and understanding of the chosen topic.
