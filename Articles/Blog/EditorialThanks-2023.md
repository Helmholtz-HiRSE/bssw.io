(This is a preliminary draft, please each member can add 200-300 words from their own experience.)

Those of us working on the bssw.io editorial board wanted to express our thanksgiving for being able to serve the CSE community towards improving Scientific Software.

**Pat Grubel:** I started on the IDEAS team as a post-doctoral researcher at Los Alamos National Laboratory and was asked to join the ECP IDEAS team when my predecessor (also my mentor) had taken on more roles at the lab so needed a replacement.
It was an opportunity to meet experts across the DOE complex who advocated for quality software to advance science, so it sounded like a good opportunity.
My first meeting with the team was an in-person meeting and I was just getting to know team members and a little bit about their roles when they wanted to split the meeting in two.
The topic I picked was to work on the bssw.io site that aimed to be a community hub for those who faced the many challenges of producing and maintaining scientific software in the increasingly complex and changing landscape of HPC.
I had spent most of my earlier career as an engineer and picked up most software on my own and had recently returned to graduate school for computer engineering.
My research included studying and improving the performance of programming models on the underlying architecture.
Although developing software was a necessary tool, and I was able to collaborate with several scientific software teams, I had not given much thought to the best practices of developing and maintaining software or the challenges that scientific software teams faced in collaborating on the the many large software projects that exist.

Looking for and reviewing articles and resources for the bssw.io site first helped me with personal organization and productivity.
Then, trying to keep up with some of the best practices that experts like other editorial board members and the community found helpful aided me with projects.
I attempted to practice some of these new (to me) ideas on my projects and was eventually asked to be the technical lead on a software project.
At that point helping the team members with productivity and best software practices became very important.
The project team has been incrementally applying some of the practices and tools found in resources and articles on the site and has been improving our processes.
I am grateful for the many articles and helpful resources on the site and glad to be a small part of it.
The best part of being on the editorial team has come from meeting the team members and working with them.
Knowing them and gleaning insights from their knowledge has been extremely helpful and enjoyable.

**David Bernholdt:** I've been working with scientific software for nearly 40 years now (geez!).  My interest in better software engineering arose out of working with some large teams on some pretty large code bases -- initially thinking that there must be a better way to do software development, and then having the opportunity to work in a team that *did* do a better and more thoughtful job with the software.  Since then, I've been trying to pick up better ways of doing things, and when I have a chance, implement them in my own work.  Over the years, I've tapped whatever I could find to help me -- people who seemed to know useful things, papers, books, etc.  So when the idea of BSSw.io came up, it seemed quite natural for me to get involved.  To me, BSSw.io is both a source to help me keep learning about software engineering and also a way to thank all of the people who I learned from by helping to make similar resources available to the larger community.

I learn something from pretty much every new article that we publish on BSSw.io because there are so many different experiences and perspectives out there.  As an editor for the site, much of my time lately has been focused on shepherding our blog series.  I particularly enjoy the contributions that bring a topic or a viewpoint that I hadn't thought about before, or in some cases, hadn't even been aware of.  A recent example, and I think appropriate for this harvest season, was the article [Long-Term Software Gardening Strategies for Cultivating Scientific Development Ecosystems](https://bssw.io/blog_posts/long-term-software-gardening-strategies-for-cultivating-scientific-development-ecosystems) by Dave Bunten and Gregory Way.  With a little sleuthing on the internet, I learned that this gardening metaphor for software stewardship was not new, but it was one that I'd never run across before.  And it really resonated with me because it addressed aspects of the software lifecycle and software ecosystems that colleagues and I have been struggling with in other projects.  The same kind of thing often happens with new curated content articles too, of course, though my experience as an editor is not as intense -- probably because I'm not immersed in someone else's writing on the topic.  As an editor, I also shepherd many of the contributions to our [event listings](https://bssw.io/events), which I really appreciate because they illustrate how vibrant and diverse the scientific software community is.

Overall, I guess I would say I'm thankful for our many contributors to BSSw.io for sharing their knowledge, experience, and energy with me and with the broader community.
