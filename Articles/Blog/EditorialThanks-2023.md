Those of us working on the bssw.io editorial board wanted to express our thanksgiving for being able to serve the CSE community towards improving Scientific Software.

Pat Grubel: I started on the IDEAS team as a post-doctoral researcher at Los Alamos National Laboratory and was asked to join the ECP IDEAS team when my predecessor (also my mentor) had taken on more roles at the lab so needed a replacement.
It was an opportunity to meet experts across the DOE complex who advocated for quality software to advance science, so it sounded like a good opportunity.
My first meeting with the team was an in-person meeting and I was just getting to know team members and a little bit about their roles when they wanted to split the meeting in two.
The topic I picked was to work on the bssw.io site that aimed to be a community hub for those who faced the many challenges of producing and maintaining scientific software in the increasingly complex and changing landscape of HPC.
I had spent most of my earlier career as an engineer and picked up most software on my own and had recently returned to graduate school for computer engineering.
My research included studying and improving the performance of programming models on the underlying architecture.
Although developing software was a necessary tool, and I was able to collaborate with several scientific software teams, I had not given much thought to the best practices of developing and maintaining software or the challenges that scientific software teams faced in collaborating on the the many large software projects that exist.

Looking for and reviewing articles and resources for the bssw.io site first helped me with personal organization and productivity.
Then, trying to keep up with some of the best practices that experts like other editorial board members and the community found helpful aided me with projects.
I attempted to practice some of these new (to me) ideas on my projects and was eventually asked to be the technical lead on a software project.
At that point helping the team members with productivity and best software practices became very important.
The project team has been incrementally applying some of the practices and tools found in resources and articles on the site and has been improving our processes.
I am grateful for the many articles and helpful resources on the site and glad to be a small part of it.
The best part of being on the editorial team has come from meeting the team members and working with them.
Knowing them and gleaning insights from their knowledge has been extremely helpful and enjoyable.
