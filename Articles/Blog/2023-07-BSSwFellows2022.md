[Better Scientific Software (BSSw) Fellowships](https://bssw.io/fellowship) provide resources and community support to those who foster and promote practices, processes, and tools to improve developer productivity and software sustainability of scientific codes.

The 2022 BSSw Fellows have used their skills to create tutorials, webinars, and tools to guide developers through various stages of the scientific software lifecycle and impact the culture of scientific software development.

Here's more about what they have been up to and their perspectives on the BSSw Fellowship Program.

### Ritu Arora

*Perspectives on the BSSw Fellowship Program:* I am very grateful to the BSSw Fellowship Program team for selecting me and giving me an opportunity to highlight the cause of optimizing I/O in scientific applications. Through this fellowship, I was able to expand my professional network and the target audience for my tutorial on "Optimizing I/O in Scientific Applications". Due to the fellowship, I was able to take time and focus on expanding and updating my previous content on optimizing I/O. I also got a chance to attend the ECP meeting in January 2023 and learn about the great work that colleagues at the DOE laboratories are doing. It feels great to be a part of a very supoortive community!

*Advice for new (prospective) BSSw Fellows:* I would suggest proposing a topic that you are very passionate about and deciding on the scope of the proposed work to be undertaken well in advance.
