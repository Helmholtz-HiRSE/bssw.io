[Better Scientific Software (BSSw) Fellowships](https://bssw.io/fellowship) provide resources and community support to those who foster and promote practices, processes, and tools to improve developer productivity and software sustainability of scientific codes.

The 2022 BSSw Fellows have used their skills to create tutorials, webinars, and tools to guide developers through various stages of the scientific software lifecycle and impact the culture of scientific software development.

Here's more about what they have been up to and their perspectives on the BSSw Fellowship Program.

### Ritu Arora

*Perspectives on the BSSw Fellowship Program:* I am very grateful to the BSSw Fellowship Program team for selecting me and giving me an opportunity to highlight the cause of optimizing I/O in scientific applications. Through this fellowship, I was able to expand my professional network and the target audience for my tutorial on "Optimizing I/O in Scientific Applications". Due to the fellowship, I was able to take time and focus on expanding and updating my previous content on optimizing I/O. I also got a chance to attend the ECP meeting in January 2023 and learn about the great work that colleagues at the DOE laboratories are doing. It feels great to be a part of a very supoortive community!

*Advice for new (prospective) BSSw Fellows:* I would suggest proposing a topic that you are very passionate about and deciding on the scope of the proposed work to be undertaken well in advance.

### Rob Latham

*Perspectives on the BSSw Fellowship Program:*

I have enjoyed seeing the concept of the Research Software Developer emerge
over the course of my career.  BSSW supports scientific software and elevates
the work developers like me carry out.  This program has connected me to lots
of bright folks and given me a peek at some of the good work going on across
the laboratory complex.

I've been giving I/O tutorials for quite a few years at this point in my
career.  With BSSW fellowship support, I reframed my typical I/O tutorial into
more of an ongoing collaboration.  I leaned on GitHub discussions for audience
engagement and structured my materials to accommodate contributions from users
running on other HPC platforms.


*Advice for new (prospective) BSSw Fellows:*

For new and future BSSw Fellows, recognize there's a tension between taking
risks and completing the task in the time allotted.  We aren't given endless
time and money -- but who is? As in many fields, operating under gentle
constraints can bring out creativity.  I appreciated BSSw's charge to produce
something that could live on once the fellowship is over.

### Amiya Maji

*Perspectives on the BSSw Fellowship Program:*

I have always been passionate about writing robust software and spent countless hours finding
and fixing bugs (and creating a few myself!). In the BSSw Fellowship program, I found
a community of like-minded individuals who are all passionate about raising the quality of
scientific software through collaboration and dissemination of best practices. I am thankful to
the BSSw Fellowship committee for providing me the opportunity to explore the best practices for
installing and managing scientific python packages. During my work at Purdue Univeristy, I had the
first-hand experience of seeing researchers struggle with installation of Python packages on HPC
clusters. To alleviate many of the common issues, I wrote a tool called [conda-env-mod](https://github.com/amaji/conda-env-mod) which
simplified the process of python environment creation, dependency tracking, and usage. The BSSw
Fellowship helped me expand the project and shape it into a more useful tool. I am hopeful that it will
help HPC python developers manage their python environments more efficiently.

The BSSw Fellowship has helped me connect with the larger RSE community and learn about the
experiences of other scientists. I am also thankful for all the feedback that I have received
about best practices for managing HPC python packages. It was oddly encouraging to see that I was
not alone in my struggles with Python package installation! I will continue to cherish the collective
knowledge, support, and encouragement of the BSSw community.


*Advice for new (prospective) BSSw Fellows:*

For new and future Fellows, I'll echo the advice of the previous Fellows. Once you start working on
your project, it may quickly expand into a larger research problem. Identify the scope of your project and start early.
Take advantage of the great networking opportunities provided by the BSSw Fellowship and don't hesitate to reach out.

### Learn more about the BSSw Fellowship Program

BSSw Fellows are selected annually based on an application process that includes the proposal of a funded activity that promotes better scientific software. See more about the [BSSw Fellowship Program](https://bssw.io/fellowship), including ongoing work of the 2023 BSSw Fellows. We will begin accepting applications for 2024 BSSw Fellowships during mid-August 2023. Register for the [BSSw mailing list](https://bssw.io/pages/receive-our-email-digest) to receive information.
