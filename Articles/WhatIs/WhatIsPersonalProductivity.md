Personal productivity for scientific software professionals is not just about
managing time, the amount of code produced, projects completed, or papers
published, but also includes overall satisfaction of their daily professional
life and how that sustains their career.

Personal productivity for scientific software professionals may sometimes be
thought of as a measure of code being developed, tasks being accomplished, or
deadlines being met. Only considering these types of measurements can lead to
sources of frustration and are not necessarily sustainable. Instead, we need to help
professionals to consider the benefits of improving practices, taking time to
learn new materials or to develop new skills, taking breaks, managing tasks and
time, collaboration, and probably the most important, taking care of their
physical and mental health and striving for good work life balance.
