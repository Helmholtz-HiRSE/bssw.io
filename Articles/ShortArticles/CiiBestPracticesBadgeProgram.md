# The CII Best Practices Badge Program

<!-- deck text start -->
The Linux Foundation's CII Best Practices Badge Program represents an impressive collection of the open source communities knowledge base for creating, maintaining, and sustaining, robust, high-quality -- and most importantly secure -- open-sorce software.
At its core is a BadgeApp website which provides a database of projects that document what best practices they support and provide supporting evidence.
This set of best practices along with the detailed documentation and supporting justification also serves as an incremental learning tool for software engineering practice.

The Linux Foundation's<sup>[linux_foundation]</sup> Core Infrastructure Initiative (CII)<sup>[cii]</sup> was an effort to improve the security and quality of open source software.  (The CII is being consumed and replaced by the new Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF)<sup>[openssf]</sup>).
The CII Best Practices Badge Program<sup>[cii_best_practices_badge_program]</sup> is an effort to collect, document, and present a comprehensive collection of best practices from the open-source software development community.
The core of this badge program is a "Badge App" site<sup>[cii_best_practices_badge_app]</sup> that allows projects to create an entry for their project and then to specify if their project meets each best practice, descriptions for how they met the criteria, and URLs to evidence (or justification for why the criteria or not met).  Many of the practices can be opted-out as Not Applicable "N.A.".  In addition, the practices are subdivided into three different levels **Passing**, **Silver**, and **Gold** and practices at each level are marked as required or optional as **MUST**, **SHOULD**, and **SUGGESTED**.

The practices are broken down in several different ways:

* Three different badge levels (N/A allowed on some MUST practices):
  * Passing: 43 MUST, 10 SHOULD, 14 SUGGESTED
  * Silver: +44 MUST, +10 SHOULD, +1 SUGGESTED
  * Gold: +21 MUST, +2 SHOULD
* Required or optional:
  * MUST
  * SHOULD
  * SUGGESTED
* Six Different Categories:
  * Basic
  * Change Control
  * Reporting
  * Quality
  * Security
  * Analysis

This set of best practices are listed as a full set<sup>[cii_best_practices_all]</sup> and also for each badge level individually and also with or without the detailed description/justification and links to more information.  Each best practice is composted of a short statement of the practice (with the word MUST, SHOULD, or SUGGESTED) and short HTML anchor name link name that serves as a link to the practice and as an unambiguous shorthand identifier for that best practice criteria.  Many items also require a short comment field be filled out and a URL to evidence.   For example, the first four best 



The detailed listing of criteria is given in Table ??? below.

Level	Total active	MUST	SHOULD	SUGGESTED	Allow N/A	Met justification required	Require URL	Met justification or URL required	Includes details	New at this level
Passing	67	43	10	14	27	1	8	9	52	67
Silver	55	44	10	1	40	38	17	54	39	48
Gold	23	21	2	0	9	13	9	22	16	14



ToDo: Describe:

* Scores in each level a provided separately for each level (show screen shot).

* Provides a standard catalog into the parts of the projects and how it handles different types of processes.

* Provides a learning tool for best practices.

* Provides a website template and database implementation that can be forked and customized for more targeted communities.

* Provides a means for continual improvement for a project as it incrementally adopts more practices and improves its scores in different areas.

* White House Executive Order 14028 that requires government and DOE software improve software security may impact CSE software.
