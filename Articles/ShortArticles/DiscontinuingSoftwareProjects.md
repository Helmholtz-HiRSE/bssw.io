# Discontinuing a Research Software Project

Software projects come to an end for a variety of reasons. A newer project
can render an older project obsolete. The market or need for a capability can
dwindle or completely disappear. A sponsoring organization can wind up making
a strategic decision to discontinue a software project. Funding can run out.

Many *research* software projects have built-in sunset dates when the sponsoring
organization's funding ends. For SciDAC projects for example, a common
duration is 3-5 years. If a project is unable to gain traction within the
community and funding from other sponsors in that time frame, the project will most
likely have to be discontinued.

Over time, on-line project assets and artifacts and even contact information of
the people involved can fall out of date and/or become inaccessible. Future
researchers are then unable to discover the project even existed let alone benefit
from any knowledge gained. The only living record is likely to be publications.
However, in scientific computing projects, publications tend to focus
on the science enabled by the software so that little if any published knowledge
about the software itself remains available.

Utilization of software project hosting providers such as SourceForge, GitHub, GitLab,
etc.  definitely helps software projects avoid some issues when discontinuing by enabling
the project to maintain a continued presence even after funding is lost. The more
services (issue tracking, email lists, web site hosting, etc.) the project utilizes
from hosting providers, the easier it is for the project to go into hibernation.
For example, GitHub features the ability to put a repository in an *archived* state.

There things project stakeholders and sponsoring organizations can do to *gracefully* 
discontinue a software project in such a way that key assets remain aviailable for
the benefit of the community.

What to do about existing users? What to do about future users?
license to transfer or support continued development by others.

One of the first things to decide is whether future project *communications* will go on
some form of life-support or be discontinued entirely. Having life-support communications
is obviously preferred but it comes at some non-zero cost and so may not be practical in
all cases. For life-support, it is important to identify *how* (e.g. email, twitter, slack)
any inquiries will be handled and by *whom* (e.g. email address, twitter handle, slack
username). This information should be posted prominently in all of the on-line spaces where
the project has a continued presence. Even if communications will be discontinued entirely,
it may make sense to provide way for inquirers to *register* their interest by some kind of
a sign-up process that collects such contact information.

Collecting such inquiries

be directed to a web page?

of

 One of the nice things about email
is that

Which modality(s) of communication with former project stakeholders will
be maintained 

* Identify the modality(s) of contact that will be maintained for any inquiries
  occurring *after* project discontinuation (e.g. email, twitter, GitHub discussions, etc.).

* Identify at least one person (preferrably 2 or 3 persons) who will serve as point
  of contact for any inquiries occuring after the project is discontinued. If this
  role needs to be transferred

* Some stakeholders should set semi-annual reminders on their calenders just to
  check and confirm the project's on-line presence is still working.
* Ensure on-line access points have a continued maintinence plan
  * as well as the systems where the below resources are hosted
  * mailing lists, discussion boards, ...
  * issue trackers
  * web site(s)
  * custom domain names
    * Custom domain names cost money and have expiration dates. In many cases, these
      custom domain names are just re-directions to a sponsoring organization's 
      own hosting resources. If so, change the re-direction for the custom domain name
      as soon as possible to an announcement page (e.g. break the redirection) indicating
      the project is discontinued. This way, while the custome domain name remains active,
      this will give time for project hosted through the sponsoring organization's own
      resources to become well known.
* Set up appropriate auto-responders on email list(s)
* Ensure various on-line access points prominently indicate that the project
  has been discontinued (or is in hibernation mode).

or is seeking funding


* security updates for hosting modalities
* For projects that involve persistent data formats, provide users with documentation
  about how to convert their data to another format.
* For projects for which decent alternative software products exist, maybe 
* Gather together whatever resources the project may have produced that help to
  explain/describe the software (slide decks from presentations, etc.)
  * This could be a simple listing of key files in the repository interested
    consumers should be aware of if they need to go look
* On GitHub, projects can be *archived* (converted to read-only)
* What can be done to ensure that if the project gets re-started, it can be easily
  picked back up and restarted by possibly new developers?
* Sponsoring organizations should be willing to allocate a small amount of remaining
  funds for teams to expend effort preparing the project for discontinuation. A good
  motive is helping to ensure the sponsor's investments to that point are not lost
  entirely.
