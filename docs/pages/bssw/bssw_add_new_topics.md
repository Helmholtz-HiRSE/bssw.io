## How to add new topics to bssw.io website

This section describes how to add new topics under the existing categories on the bssw.io site.

The following are the steps to be followed:

* Go to https://github.com/betterscientificsoftware/bssw.io
* Modify the appropriate file in Site/Topics to add the new topic. These files are named by category names and these files control the topics and the order in which they are presented, so you can put the topic anywhere in the category list you want if you adjust the sequence numbers.
* Make a PR, add the preview label, and rebuild the preview site.
* Check that the topic appears when you look at the Resources drop-down. (The topic will not have any resources under it, at this stage.)
* Merge the PR and rebuild the main site.
