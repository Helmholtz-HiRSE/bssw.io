Focus | Agile Techniques for Scientific Research Software Teams

[The United States Research Software Engineer Association (US RSE)](us-rse.org) presented the webinar, [Agile Project Management](https://youtu.be/Fdex2rhw0Zo). The first six minutes of the video is an overview of US RSE, a community organization for those who write and contribute to research software. After the US RSE overview, Angela presents the main topic where she explains how to modify the agile process especially Scrum to do science.

Like any software team, research teams need to stay organized, manage changes, write reports, and collaborate efficiently. Angela explains how to do this with minimul effort. Angela briefly explains what Scrum is, why scientists should like Scrum, who uses it, and how it is used. Then she explains the roles, ceremonies, and artifacts of Scrum. After her presentation, Angela fields questions from the audience; her explanations are very informative and help adapting Scrum for any software team.

The webinar inspired me to start using some of the techniques with a small team. Since my background is engineering, I had no formal training in the agile techniques, but could glean enough information from the webinar to start applying a few of the techniques to help plan and organize work. I am hoping this will make using agile methods easy to incorporate gradually while being flexible and encouraging team members to work on what they would like to. Watching the webinar made me excited to apply some of the techniques without overburdening the team and adding a bit of fun to the process.
