The article *Breaking apart the monolith* discusses how we expect maintainers to be comprehensive generalists with the expectation that they will work on all aspects of the project, including but not limited to, code, documentation, maintenance, community relationships, project management. The expectation, most times, is also that they would work on all these aspects for the entire life of the project. The article argues that this is not a sustainable approach and we need solutions to break apart this "maintainers monolith".

The article encourages the scientific community to learn and get inspired from the working models in government and other social sectors of society that have tackled similar problems, but in a different context. The article argues that any solution (to break this maintainers monolith) that only addresses financial aspects and glosses over the human elements makes things worse by ratcheting up expectations for maintainers.

The latter part of the article discusses attempts at solutions made on this topic. It explores the maintainers.md file concept (supported on platforms such as Github) and discusses whether this could become a prominent element of all open source projects. The article emphasizes the need to understand human motivation and the importance of devising human solutions to such human problems.  One needs to ensure that project maintainership will not become a never-ending, unscoped, tiresome burden.
