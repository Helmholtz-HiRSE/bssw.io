### Jupyter Notebook and the Jupyter Ecosystem
Computational notebooks, including Jupyter Notebooks, come in many varieties, but they all have one thing in common: much like traditional laboratory notebooks, computational notebooks contain code cells interspersed with text that can be used to explain their analysis.

Jupyter is a large umbrella project that covers many different software offerings and tools, including the popular Jupyter Notebook classic interface and JupyterLab web-based notebook development environments.



### Jupyter4Science Mission

The Jupyter4Science knowledge base is intended for a **research-oriented audience**, including computational scientists, [research software engineers](https://us-rse.org/about/what-is-an-rse/) (RSEs), [academic data scientists](https://academicdatascience.org/community-projects/career-guidebook/), social scientists, digital humanities researchers, and students, and anyone else who use Jupyter Notebooks to conduct research. Our aim is to provide rich resources for researchers, students, and research and data ([RCD](https://carcc.org/)) professionals about **better practices** to improve the **accessibility**, **reuse**, and **reproducibility** of their scientific software, data, and computational workflows.
