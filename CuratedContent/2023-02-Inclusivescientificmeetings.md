The *Guide for Inclusive Scientific Meetings*, created by the  *500 Women Scientists* organization, presents post-pandemic recommendations for getting the most out of planned gatherings by maximizing inclusivity and equality. The updated 2023 guide (previously published in 2019) covers the range of meeting modalities -- in-person, hybrid, and virtual. The document begins with an overview of the general principles of inclusion before continuing into the main sections of 1) planning the meeting, 2) during the meeting, and 3) assessing the meeting. The Guide targets people in planning and leadership positions for scientific meetings and seeks to reframe the process of meeting planning with awareness and equitable participation.

The pandemic years enforced the move to online meetings; and the routine science conferences vanished.  This guide seeks to take the learning and best practices from the zoom/teams/screen interactions and move forward with a fresh range of meeting planning.  This Guide aims to create “The art of the science meeting: how to do it really well—the fine points” from start to finish. 

The Guide to Inclusive Scientific Meetings is well worth a read, particularly with a view to the resuming frequency of in-person interactions.
