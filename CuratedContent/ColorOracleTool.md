Color Oracle (https://colororacle.org/index.html) enables developers to evaluate their designs as they appear to those with color vision impairments. This free color blindness simulator applies filters to the images to show three different types of color blindness.  

This tool is the initial one to be featured as part of an upcoming series of tools that address interfaces for different abilities.
