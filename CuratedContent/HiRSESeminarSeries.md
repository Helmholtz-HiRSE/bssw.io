# HiRSE Seminar Series

The HiRSE Seminar Series is a series of talks on the topic of Research Software Engineering. The seminars cover a broad range of topics from political to technical ones, taking place every 2 to 4 weeks. The events are open to everyone interested and held online via Zoom. The talks are recorded and published on the [HiRSE YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@Helmholtz_Platform_for_RSE) if the speakers agree. Slides can be found on the [HiRSE Zenodo community](https://zenodo.org/communities/hirse/).

The upcoming seminars are announced in the US and UK slack channels as well as the German de-RSE mailing list and other RSE community platforms. Details on the next seminars can also be found on the [HiRSE calendar feed](https://b2drop.eudat.eu/apps/calendar/p/Z9NWzFdrS8fAXPd9).
