The Special Issue of Journal in Computing in Science and Engineering, published in May-June 2022, focussed on a variety of articles selected from over 26 white papers and teatime submissions to the Collegeville Workshop 2021 (CW21). The Collegeville Workshop Series on Scientific Software brings together members from the academic, industry, and research laboratory communities to discuss important and emerging topics in the development and use of software for scientific discovery. The theme of the 2021 Collegeville Workshop was to explore the role of scientific software teams andto reflect on the approaches they have used, exchange thoughts and experiences toward the goal of better characterizing team structures and dynamics, and create and share insights into how scientific software teams can become more effective and efficient. Three major themes were highlighted at the workshop: experiences and challenges of software teams, technical approaches for improving teams, and cultural approaches for improvement. The five articles in this special issue touch on all three themes, providing insight and strategies for people who want to understand and improve how team-based scientific software is developed and use



This special issue is good read for anyone working or leading scientific software teams.
